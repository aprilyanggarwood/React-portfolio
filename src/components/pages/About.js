                  My name is April. I have a lot of sales, customer service, and
                  marketing work experience with my priviouse and current jobs
                  both in China and America. My work experiences have taught me
                  to ask questions and pay attention to detail, as these are
                  really important for people to succeed in their career.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Humility, teamwork, and curiosity are my strengths in both my
                  professional and educational career. I believe that everyone
                  around me could be my teacher/mentor in my life and career.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Good collaboration and a good relationship with colleagues can
                  make us more efficient and productive during our daily work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Currently, I am pursuing a certificate in a full stack
                  web-development at University of Washington. I am motivating
                  myself to learn computer coding skills because there are more
                  job opportunities in this job field, and my interest and
                  curiosity brought me into this field. I love to keep my skills
                  up to date in order to better fit this new technologic world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, as we know, more and more people love/need to use the
                  web or mobile applications to do more things at their
                  convenience. Therefore, my goals in my future tech career are
                  to help companies to create and develop easy-to-use
                  applications based on company and userâ€™s needs in order to
                  build an online channel for both sides to efficiently interact
                  and communicate 24/7.
